Dear friends and other acquaintances,
Seen yesterday or lost sight of for too long,

It is with great pride, and immense pleasure, that I announce the publication of the prototype version of my project to help design lands in permaculture!
If you feel like it, go check it out and leave your opinion via the little form. Collecting opinions is the most important part for me, because it will tell me which way to go for the next stages of development!
The website can be used on mobile, but it's more pleasant to use on a computer.

Thank you in advance for the feedbacks, and take good care of yourselves!
